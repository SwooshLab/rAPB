The whole emulator is currently set-up to connect to 127.0.0.1, so all you need to do is download the code and compile it or just start the binaries from "APB SERVER" folder.

Go to https://github.com/fiki574/rAPB/wiki for help on setting the server up.

You CANNOT enter districts yet.

Here you can find variety of tools, source codes, executables, information, etc. that can and will help you in researching/developing rAPB (if you wonder what rAPB means, it's short form of rebornAPB).
